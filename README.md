Make it Run, Make it Right
==========================

Code from our session looking at three different implementation strategies of TDD from Kent Beck's TDD By Example.

See [my blog post on it](https://relentlessdevelopment.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/make-it-run-make-it-right-the-three-implementation-strategies-of-tdd/) for further details.

The problem is creating a prefix calculator, e.g. taking a string like

    + 1 2
	
and calculating the answer (in this case, 3).

The details can be found somewhere in the [LCD Events Archive](http://leedscodedojo.github.io/archive.html).
